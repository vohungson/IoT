1. The server should now remember the user history.
Configure an authentication mechanism with passwords. Update the protocol specification to allow users to be authenticated.

  ![Alt text](images/authbasic.png?raw=true "authentification basique")

  -  To authenticate users, use a database such as `sqlite`. In particular, you can use the `sqlite3` module.
  - Passwords should never be stored clearly in a database. Thus, you must use a hash algorithm such as `bcrypt`, and use the module` node.js` named `bcrypt`.
  - See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)  
> **Warning, Authentication does not mean security **.

1. We want to ensure secure communication between clients and servers.

![Alt text](images/secure.png?raw=true "Encrypted Authentication")

To this end, we want to encrypt messages between clients and servers because the communication channel is not safe. Capture the communication traffic between a client and a server to emphasize that the protocol is dangerous. For example, you can use `wirehark` ...

>Note that the client and the server do not know each other in advance. **Theo** wants to interact with the server in a safe manner. In other terms,
**Theo** wants to interact with the server while avoiding
 Max interpreting and reading the exchanged messages. It is possible to encrypt messages by using `symetric encryption`, i.e., by using a key or a password. But how is it possible to exchange a secret without Max intercepting it??

#### Explanations
> To resolve this issue, you should use an asymetric encryption technique. More particularly, we are going to use the algorithm from **Diffie-Hellman** with an elliptic curve (`ECDH`). See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange)
>
>The main objective of 'ECDH' is to setup a secret between two parties throught an unsecured channel and without exchanging the secret. !!
 Both **Théo** and the server generate a key pair public/private with the use of **ECDH**.
The public key can be shared with everybody whereas the private key must remain private and never be exchanged. Thus,
 **Théo** and the server can exchange together the public key. Finally, a shared secret can then be generated at both sides of the communication by combining the private and the public key. Hence, if **Max** is listening the communication, he has probably intercepted the public key from **Theo** and/or from the server. However, he will be unable to compute the same secret without the private keys.
 Once **Théo** and the server have the same shared secret, then they can use a symmetric encryption to exchange their messages without
**Max** being able to decrypt them.


- Setup new messages to enable to secure the messsage exchanges by using **ECDH** between clients and servers. To this end, you can use the `crypto` module from `node.js`. See [https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)

#### Recommandations

>- To use `ECDH` see the documentation
[https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_ecdh](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_ecdh)
>
> - For the symmetric encryption use the
`aes-256-cbc` encryption. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
>
>- To use `AES` with `node.js`, See the documentation
[https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_cipher](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_cipher)
and
[https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createcipher_algorithm_password_options](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createcipher_algorithm_password_options)
>
>- It is strongly recommanded to use an initalization vector (`iv`). See
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector).
>
>- To use a `iv` in `node.js` See the  documentation
[https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createcipheriv_algorithm_key_iv_options](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createcipheriv_algorithm_key_iv_options)

3.  From your point of view, all the above improvement is enough secure to be protected from **Max**? If no, suggest a solution.
